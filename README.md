PublifyReferences
=================

This is a small command line application that creates all-public reference assemblies.

Use as: `PublifyReferences.exe Source[Folder|File]-Path DestinationFolder-Path`  
It will create barebones public assemblies of the source file or all files in the source folder and output them to the destination folder.
